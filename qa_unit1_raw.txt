The full syntax of the elements allowed in the body  element is a bit more involved than 
the full syntax of the head . This diagram shows what is directly included in the body:
body

h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6
div
ul, ol
dt, dd
pre
blockquote
address
fieldset
table

an example, take the p element and continue to expand, keeping in mind that these 
elements will also loop back on each other and expand out as well:
While it might be difficult to meaningfully present the entire syntax of HTML 
graphically in a diagram, the diagram presented here should drive home the point that 
HTML is quite structured and the details of how elements may be used are quite clear. Now that you have some insight into the syntax of markup, the next section discusses how browsers deal with it.
Browsers and (X)HTML
When a browser reads a marked-up document, such as the “hello world” example repeated here,
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN"  
"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd"> 
<html> <head> <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">  
<title>Hello HTML World</title> <!-- Simple hello world in HTML 4.01 strict example -->

it builds a parse tree to interpret the structure of the document, possibly like this:
DOCTYPE
HTML
HEAD
META
TITLE
BODY
H1
HR

“Welcome to the world of HTML”
“Really”
“isn’t so hard!”
“soon you will &hearts; using HTML.”
“You could put lots of text here if you want. We
could go on and on with fake text for you
to read, but let’s get back to the book.”“Hello HTML World”Legend

interpretation of the markup provided and are integral to determining how to render the 
page visually using both default (X)HTML style and any
